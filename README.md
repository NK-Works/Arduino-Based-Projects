Arduino-based Car Projects with Bluetooth and RF Modules

This repository contains Arduino-based projects for controlling cars using Bluetooth and RF Modules. There are three projects in this repository:

    Bluetooth Car
    Bluetooth LCD Car
    Communication between Two Cars using Arduino and RF Module

Requirements

To run these projects, you will need:

    Arduino board (UNO, Mega, Nano, etc.)
    Motor driver module (L298N, L293D, etc.)
    HC-05 Bluetooth module
    16x2 LCD display (only for Bluetooth LCD Car project)
    RF module (only for Communication between Two Cars project)
    Breadboard and jumper wires
    DC motors and wheels
    12/9V battery for the motor driver module
    USB cable for the Arduino board

Bluetooth Car

The Bluetooth Car project allows you to control a car using an Android app via Bluetooth. The car can move forward, backward, left, and right. The Android app sends commands to the HC-05 Bluetooth module connected to the Arduino board, which then controls the DC motors through the motor driver module.

To run the project, upload the "Blu_Car.ino" sketch to the Arduino board and connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram in the project folder. Then, install the "Bluetooth RC Controller" app on your Android device and pair it with the HC-05 Bluetooth module. Open the app and start controlling the car.

Bluetooth LCD Car:

The Bluetooth LCD Car project is similar to the Bluetooth Car project, but it also displays the current car status (e.g., direction, speed) on a 16x2 LCD display. The LCD display is connected to the Arduino board via the I2C protocol.

To run the project, upload the "LCD_Car.ino" sketch to the Arduino board and connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram in the project folder. Then, install the "Bluetooth RC Controller" app on your Android device and pair it with the HC-05 Bluetooth module. Open the app and start controlling the car. The car status will be displayed on the LCD display.

Communication between Two Cars using Arduino and RF Module:

The Communication between Two Cars project allows two cars to communicate with each other using RF modules. Each car is equipped with an Arduino board and an RF module. One car acts as a transmitter and the other as a receiver. When the transmitter sends a signal, the receiver receives it and responds accordingly.

To run the project, upload the "RF_Master.ino" sketch to one Arduino board and the "RD_Follower.ino" sketch to the other Arduino board. Connect the components as shown in the circuit diagram in the project folder. Turn on both cars and press the buttons on the transmitter to send signals to the receiver. The receiver will respond by moving the car in the appropriate direction.

Communication between a PC and Arduino Car:

To this, we can start with any of the above three codes as the back-end while to develop the GUI aka front-end you can use any of the coding languages available. In our case, we have used python to make the GUI. Finally, we have to connect the GUI to the codes uploaded in the Arduino and run the car using the PC.

Conclusion

These projects demonstrate the power of the Arduino platform for building and controlling robots. With the help of Bluetooth and RF modules, we can easily control and communicate with our Arduino-based cars. Also, creating a custom GUI in your PC to run the car is an interesting aspect which requires deep understanding of the coding and communication between robots concepts. We hope you find these projects helpful and informative.
